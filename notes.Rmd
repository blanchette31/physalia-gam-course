## Notes for GAMs course

# Day 1

Start with co2_south-pole-example then larks then linnets

# Day 3

Slides : 

## 8
Test to figure out if a non linear model is suitable for the data but in Gavin's opinion we should not have to do this because the penalty will not allow over wiggliness.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(mgcv)
n <- 100
set.seed(2)
df <- tibble(x = runif(n),
             y = x + x^2 * 0.2 + rnorm(n) * 0.1)
model <- gam(y ~ x + s(x, m = c(2, 0)),
             data = df, method = "REML")
model2 <- gam(y ~ s(x),
             data = df, method = "REML")

summary(model)
summary(model2)
```


## 11
not all of the smooths can be used to estimate the second derivative as the penalty makes the second derivative as small as possible



## 21

Why the thin plate spline doesn't work when the scale on x and z is different but the tensor product is much better for this case


## 25 
Last line : make sure that the data in place of "f" is a factor if not you will get a cryptic error message


## 37

we should look to see if there's a difference between k' and edf and if k-index is low (unmodelled wigliness) 

if the k index is too low it means that the values near each other aren't similar we want the k-index to be greater than one or at least close (if its close check the p-value if not don't worry about the p-value too much)

## 38
s(x2) doesnt have enough degrees of freedom now that s(x1) is figured out and has enough degrees of freedom

s(x2) edf and k' are good (there is enough head room in terms of k for the)

## 40 

we need more degrees of freedom to force the curve to go flat (slope is changing faster more often so we need more degrees of freedom)

## 41

there a 2 scenarios where this test will fail

## 42 
k-index is not the same here as we saw before

## 43

fitting gam model to residuals 

if we had the basis size correct the edfs should be 1 here they are not

## 45

model diagnostics we need to do if we are to validate any model

## 47

3. can help us diagnose non constant variance

##48

here is what happens when we have the correct model

rep = 500 : simulates 500 new data sets from the model using the fitted values

if your data looks like a typical example from the model then your model is good

you want all your points to be on line line in the first graph you can expect some variation though

second graph : if there is an increase in spread if we increase the mean of the residuals then we have the wrong mean residuals relationship **It should be constant**

## 49

example of bad model fit overdispersion 

plot 3 is too fat in the tails and we can see the same thing in the first plot 

## 51

do the same thing as before but using ggplot

## 55

here we have the wrong family so we have overdispersion and we are testing for that 

our dispersion should be 1 so its very overdispersed p-value is significant so does not support the null hypothesis that it is correctly dispersed

## 56
no sign that the data and model are different in terms of their dispersions

## 57

takes our fitted model and simulates residuals and we can do other tests

## 58 

KS test tells us if we have the correct distribution significant means we dont have the correct family

## 59 

this is what good model diagnostics looks like

## 61

we should be really careful about trying to get something really parsimonious

##  67

3rd arrow adding several variables that have no effect 

very noisy situation 

## 68 

edf for all the terms that have no effect have all been shrunk to 0 or almost 0 so are basically all out of the model 

## 69

scales = fixed gives us all the same scales for all the plots

## 74
expected value of temperature : E

F(TOD) = water temperature will vary depending on time of day it was sampled

f(DOY) = water temperature will vary throughout the year

f(Year) = long term water temperature variation 


## 75
f(x,y,TOD) effect of time of day might be different depending on location

##78 
we use ti here so it doesnt include the main effects multiple times in the model ti() does not include the main effect of a variable so we can use it s() to add the main effects and ti() to add the interactions between the variables

knots upper limit set to 366.5 to get predictions for years with leap years 

we should make sure we're using the same basis functions for the main effects and the interactions for the same variable **for example bs = "ds" for LONGITUDE LATITUDE**

## 79
reasonable null model that just has the effect of climate change

## 81 

clearly the spatial model is much better than the null model

## 83

probably a problem with the data in the figure in the top right the temperature would not increase that fast and settle back down that fast

## 84

with the development version of gratia you can make theses plots 

DOY seems to be the variable with the most effect here

time of day seems to have the smallest effect since it has the smallest range

## 85 

data slice TOD = 12 and DOY 180

so we're fixing the time of day and the day of year so that we can predict the spatial effects

## 89 

lets pick a point of the bay and we want to see the trends at that point at different days of the year

## 90

seems to be a trend in the fall where the temperature is increasing 


# Day 4

Slides : 

## 11 

you should probably use this if it is available to use (REML AND ML)

## 19 
we should not be relying on p-values to make decisions according to statisticians we're over relying on them

if the effect is significant and the variable is biologically important then you should keep it regardless of p-value 

## 42

no advantage to fitting this model if there is no trend at a population level 

it's more of an average smooth 

## 45

we decompose the average effect and then how individuals respond differently from the common pattern

if there is a common pattern it can be beneficial (simpler more parsimonious, aka few degrees of freedom, model) to model a hierarchial gam to get the common pattern and then how individuals differ from that common pattern

## 49

average species richness over the whole area over time according to hte model 

we can see that it oscillates

## 50

we would like to allow a spatial smoothness

## 51

controlling the degrees of freedom in each direction

tw family because the biomass can be 0 and it is really good for that  continuous observation that can be skewed

## 52

how we can get meaningful results from our model

we would ideally like to get predictions 

## 53

this model ignores space so it's not correct right now but it's just an example 

new_year : take the minimum year and max year and give 100 values in between them and then we can predict from that new dataframe

this is all in the log scale so we need to back transform this data to the response scale

crit = 89% confidence interval

## 55

the bands are probably wrong because the species richness is probably spatially auto-correlated because we're not taking into account spatial distribution 

## 56

sp_new = 100 new evenly distributed x and y coordonates for each year

## 57 

remove created coordonates that are on land using exclude.too.far and providing the original data

## 61

you have to use the smooths function to know what the name of the smooths are so that we can exclude them from the predict 

## 62 

exclude = remove the smooths we dont want to predict with so this model will just model the average biomass over time 

## 64

we can use the fitted_values function in gratia to do all the previous code for simple models and we dont have to worry about the confidence intervals and back transforming them 

## 65 

simulate data from the model

## 82

you should simulate at least 10000 or 50000 in beta_sim <- here he used 1000 just so sit runs a bit faster
