# Predicting with `predict()`

`plot.gam()` and `gratia::draw()` show the component functions of the model on the link scale

Prediction allows us to evaluate the model at known values of covariates on the response scale

Use the standard function `predict()`

Provide `newdata` with a data frame of values of covariates

---

# `predict()`

```{r predict-newdata}
new_year <- with(shrimp, tibble(year = seq(min(year), max(year), length.out = 100)))
pred <- predict(m_rich, newdata = new_year, se.fit = TRUE, type = "link")
pred <- bind_cols(new_year, as_tibble(as.data.frame(pred)))
pred
```

---

# `predict()` &rarr; response scale

```{r predict-newdata-resp}
ilink <- inv_link(m_rich)                         # inverse link function
crit <- qnorm((1 - 0.89) / 2, lower.tail = FALSE) # or just `crit <- 2`
pred <- mutate(pred, richness = ilink(fit),
               lwr = ilink(fit - (crit * se.fit)), # lower...
               upr = ilink(fit + (crit * se.fit))) # upper credible interval
pred
```

---

# `predict()` &rarr; plot

Tidy objects like this are easy to plot with `ggplot()`

```{r plot-predictions-richness, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(pred, aes(x = year)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr), alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_line(aes(y = richness)) + labs(y = "Species richness", x = NULL)
```

---

# `predict()` for space and time

This idea is very general;  spatiotemporal model needs a grid of x,y coordinates for each year

```{r spt-example-predict}
sp_new <- with(shrimp, expand.grid(x = seq_min_max(x, n = 100), y = seq_min_max(y, n = 100),
                                   year = unique(year)))
sp_pred <- predict(m_spt, newdata = sp_new, se.fit = TRUE) # link scale is default
sp_pred <- bind_cols(as_tibble(sp_new), as_tibble(as.data.frame(sp_pred)))
sp_pred
```

---

# `predict()` &rarr; response scale

```{r spt-example-response-scale}
ilink <- inv_link(m_spt)
too_far <- exclude.too.far(sp_pred$x, sp_pred$y, shrimp$x, shrimp$y, dist = 0.1)
sp_pred <- sp_pred %>% mutate(biomass = ilink(fit),
                              biomass = case_when(too_far ~ NA_real_,
                                                  TRUE ~ biomass))
sp_pred
```

---

# `predict()` &rarr; plot

```{r spt-example-plot, fig.height = 5.5, dev="png", dpi = 300}
ggplot(sp_pred, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = biomass)) + geom_raster() +
    scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma") + facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 5) + coord_equal()
```

```{r show-m-spt}

How would you visualize the average change in biomass over time?

---

# Welcome back old friend

One way is to  decompose the spatio-temporal function in main effects plus interaction

```{r shrimp-ti-model}
m_ti <- gam(shrimp ~ ti(x, y, year, d = c(2, 1), bs = c("tp", "cr"), k = c(20, 5)) +
                s(x, y, bs = "tp", k = 20) +
                s(year, bs = "cr", k = 5),
            data = shrimp, family = tw, method = "REML")
```

and predict from the model using only the marginal effect of `s(year)`

---

# `predict()` with `exclude`

.col-6[

.col-6[
.smaller[
```{r summary-spt-ti}

]
]
]

---

# `predict()` with `exclude` &mdash; Step 2 *predict*

Prediction data only need dummy values for `x` and `y`

```{r pred-data-ti-model}
ti_new <- with(shrimp, expand.grid(x = mean(x), y = mean(y), year = seq_min_max(year, n = 100)))

ti_pred <- predict(m_ti, newdata = ti_new, se.fit = TRUE,
                   exclude = c("ti(x,y,year)", "s(x,y)")) #<<

ti_pred <- bind_cols(as_tibble(ti_new), as_tibble(as.data.frame(ti_pred))) %>%
    mutate(biomass = ilink(fit),
           lwr = ilink(fit - (crit * se.fit)),
           upr = ilink(fit + (crit * se.fit)))
```

`exclude` takes a character vector of terms to exclude &mdash; `predict()` sets the contributions of those terms to 0

Could also use `terms = "s(year)"` to select only the named smooths

```{r pred-data-ti-model-terms, results = "hide"}
predict(m_ti, newdata = ti_new, se.fit = TRUE, terms = "s(year)")
```

---

# `predict()` with `exclude`&mdash; Step 3 *plot it!*

```{r plot-ti-marginal-trend, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(ti_pred, aes(x = year)) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr), alpha = 0.3) +
    geom_line(aes(y = biomass)) + labs(y = "Biomass", x = NULL)
```

---

# Using `fitted_values()`

```{r predict-via-fitted-values, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
ti_pred2 <- fitted_values(m_ti, data = ti_new,
                          scale = "response",
                          exclude = c("ti(x,y,year)", "s(x,y)")) #<<

ggplot(ti_pred2, aes(x = year)) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(y = fitted)) + labs(y = "Biomass", x = NULL)

Where did the faint grey lines come from?

---

# Posterior distributions

Each line is a draw from the *posterior distribution* of the smooth

Remember the coefficients for each basis function?: $\beta_j$

Together they are distributed *multivariate normal* with

* mean vector given by $\hat{\beta}_j$
* covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\hat{V}}_{\beta}$

$$\text{MVN}(\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{V}}_{\beta})$$

--

The model as a whole has a posterior distribution too

--

We can simulate data from the model by taking draws from the posterior distribution

---

# Posterior simulation for a smooth

Sounds fancy but it's only just slightly more complicated than using `rnorm()`

To do this we need a few things:

1. The vector of model parameters for the smooth, $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$
2. The covariance matrix of those parameters, $\boldsymbol{\hat{V}}_{\beta}$
3. A matrix $\boldsymbol{X}_p$ that maps parameters to the linear predictor for the smooth

$$\boldsymbol{\hat{\eta}}_p = \boldsymbol{X}_p \boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$$

--

Let's do this for `m_rich`

---

# Posterior sim for a smooth &mdash; step 1

The vector of model parameters for the smooth, $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$

```{r richness-coefs}
sm_year <- get_smooth(m_rich, "s(year)") # extract the smooth object from model
idx <- gratia:::smooth_coefs(sm_year)    # indices of the coefs for this smooth
idx

beta <- coef(m_rich)                     # vector of model parameters
beta[idx]                                # coefs for this smooth
```

---

# Posterior sim for a smooth &mdash; step 2

The covariance matrix of the model parameters, $\boldsymbol{\hat{V}}_{\beta}$

```{r richness-vcov, results = "hide"}
Vb <- vcov(m_rich) # default is the bayesian covariance matrix
Vb
```

.small[
```{r richness-vcov-print, echo = FALSE}
op <- options(width = 170)
Vb
options(op)
```
]

---

# Posterior sim for a smooth &mdash; step 3

A matrix $\boldsymbol{X}_p$ that maps parameters to the linear predictor for the smooth

We get $\boldsymbol{X}_p$ using the `predict()` method with `type = "lpmatrix"`

```{r richness-xp-matrix}
new_year <- with(shrimp, tibble(year = seq_min_max(year, n = 100)))
Xp <- predict(m_rich, newdata = new_year, type = "lpmatrix")
dim(Xp)
```

---

# Posterior sim for a smooth &mdash; step 4

Take only the columns of $\boldsymbol{X}_p$ that are involved in the smooth of `year`

```{r richness-reduce-xp}
Xp <- Xp[, idx, drop = FALSE]
dim(Xp)
```

---

# Posterior sim for a smooth &mdash; step 5

Simulate parameters from the posterior distribution of the smooth of `year`

```{r richness-simulate-params}
set.seed(42)
beta_sim <- rmvn(n = 20, beta[idx], Vb[idx, idx, drop = FALSE])
dim(beta_sim)
```

Simulating many sets (20) of new model parameters from the estimated parameters and their uncertainty (covariance)

Result is a matrix where each row is a set of new model parameters, each consistent with the fitted smooth

---

# Posterior sim for a smooth &mdash; step 6

.row[
.col-6[
Form $\boldsymbol{\hat{\eta}}_p$, the posterior draws for the smooth

```{r richness-posterior-draws, fig.height = 5, fig.show = "hide"}
sm_draws <- Xp %*% t(beta_sim)
dim(sm_draws)
matplot(sm_draws, type = "l")
```

A bit of rearranging is needed to plot with `ggplot()`
]

.col-6[
```{r richness-posterior-draws, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
```
]

]

--

Or use `smooth_samples()`

---

# Posterior sim for a smooth &mdash; steps 1&ndash;6

```{r plot-posterior-smooths, fig.height = 5}
sm_post <- smooth_samples(m_rich, "s(year)", n = 20, seed = 42)
draw(sm_post)
```

---

# Posterior simulation from the model

Simulating from the posterior distribution of the model requires 1 modification of the recipe for a smooth and one extra step

We want to simulate new values for all the parameters in the model, not just the ones involved in a particular smooth

--

Additionally, we could simulate *new response data* from the model and the simulated parameters (**not shown** below)

---

# Posterior simulation from the model

```{r posterior-sim-model}
beta <- coef(m_rich)   # vector of model parameters
Vb <- vcov(m_rich)     # default is the bayesian covariance matrix
Xp <- predict(m_rich, type = "lpmatrix")
set.seed(42)
beta_sim <- rmvn(n = 1000, beta, Vb) # simulate parameters
eta_p <- Xp %*% t(beta_sim)        # form linear predictor values
mu_p <- inv_link(m_rich)(eta_p)    # apply inverse link function

mean(mu_p[1, ]) # mean of posterior for the first observation in the data
quantile(mu_p[1, ], probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
```

---

# Posterior simulation from the model

```{r posterior-sim-model-hist, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(tibble(richness = mu_p[587, ]), aes(x = richness)) +
    geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Posterior richness for obs #587")
```

---

# Posterior simulation from the model

Or easier using `fitted_samples()`

```{r richness-fitted-samples, fig.height = 4.5}
rich_post <- fitted_samples(m_rich, n = 1000, newdata = shrimp, seed = 42)
ggplot(filter(rich_post, row == 587), aes(x = fitted)) +
    geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Posterior richness for obs #587", x = "Richness")
```

---

# Why is this of interest?

Say you wanted to get an estimate for the total biomass of shrimp over the entire region of the trawl survey for 2007

You could predict for the spatial grid for `year == 2007` using code shown previously and sum the predicted biomass values over all the grid cells

--

**Easy**

--

But what if you also wanted the uncertainty in that estimate?

--

**Hard**

--

**Math** üò±üò± "something, something, delta method, something" üò±üò±

---

# Posterior simulation makes this easy

1. Take a draw from the posterior distribution of the model
2. Use the posterior draw to predict biomass for each grid cell
3. Sum the predicted biomass values over all grid cells
4. Store the total biomass value
5. Repeat 1&ndash;4 a lot of times to get posterior distribution for total biomass
6. Summarize the total biomass posterior
    * Estimated total biomass is the mean of the total biomass posterior
	* Uncertainty is some lower/upper tail probability quantiles of the posterior

---

# Let's do it

```{r total-biomass-posterior-1}
sp_new <- with(shrimp, expand.grid(x = seq_min_max(x, n = 100), y = seq_min_max(y, n = 100),
                                   year = 2007))
Xp <- predict(m_spt, newdata = sp_new, type = "lpmatrix")

## work out now which points are too far now
too_far <- exclude.too.far(sp_new$x, sp_new$y, shrimp$x, shrimp$y, dist = 0.1)

beta <- coef(m_spt)                  # vector of model parameters
Vb <- vcov(m_spt)                    # default is the bayesian covariance matrix
set.seed(42)
beta_sim <- rmvn(n = 1000, beta, Vb) # simulate parameters
eta_p <- Xp %*% t(beta_sim)          # form linear predictor values
mu_p <- inv_link(m_spt)(eta_p)       # apply inverse link function
```

Columns of `mu_p` contain the expected or mean biomass for each grid cell per area trawled

Sum the columns of `mu_p` and summarize

---

# Summarize the expected biomass

```{r total-biomass-posterior-2, dependson = -1}
mu_copy <- mu_p              # copy mu_p

# Example

---

# Max species abundance

We have measurements of the abundance of a particular species along an environmental gradient

```{r}
spp_url <- "https://bit.ly/spp-gradient"
gradient <- read_csv(spp_url, col_types = "dd")
gradient
```

---

# Max species abundance

Tasks

1. fit a suitable GAM (the data are counts)

2. estimate the value of the environmental gradient where the species reaches its maximal abundance and use *posterior simulation* to provide an uncertainty estimate for this value

---

# Addendum

We used a *Gaussian approximation* to the model posterior distribution

This works well for many models but it's an approximation and can fail when the posterior is far from Gaussian

Other options include

1. using integrated nested Laplace approximation `mgcv::ginla()`
2. using a Metropolis Hastings sampler `mgcv::gam.mh()`

See `?mgcv::gam.mh` for an example where Gaussian approximation fails badly

--

`fitted_samples()`, `smooth_samples()` etc only do Gaussian approximation *currently*

# Smoothing autocorrelated data

What about smoothing where $x$ is time? Is this still a problem?

--

Yes *and* No

--

Depends on how you want to decompose *time* again

---

# Temporal dependence

Temporal dependence really means that observations that are close together in time tend to be similar to one another than observations well separated in time

How similar depends on the memory length of the system

--

Strong dependence &mdash; high autocorrelatation &,dash; long memory

Weak dependence &mdash; low autocorrelatation &,dash; short memory

---

# Temporal dependence

What does a GAM say about our data?

--

It says that observations near to one another (in covariate space) are more similar than observations further apart

---

# Temporal dependence & GAMs

From this perspective then

Wiggly smooths = Strong dependence

Smooth (!) smooths = Weak dependence

---

# Temporal dependence & GAMs

If you don't like your trend to be that wiggly, what to do?

--

You could decompose the temporal effect into a smooth trend *plus* an autocorrelated process in the $\varepsilon$

--

That process could be ARMA(*p*, *q*) or a continuous time AR(1)

# But&hellip;

This can only work if the trend and the autocorrelation process are separately identifiable from the data

Or you are willing to impose constraints on one of

* the smooth of time (using a low `k`), or

* specify the parameters of the autocorrelation process

See [Simpson (2018)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2018.00149) for a brief discussion on this plus examples & the cited references therein

# Distributional models

So far we have modelled the mean or $\mathbb{E}(\boldsymbol{y})$

We either assumed the variance was constant (Gaussian) or followed a prescribed form implied by the family / random component used (GLMs / GAMs)

What if the data don't follow these assumptions?

--

We could model all the parameters of the distribution

---

# Parameters beyond the mean

```{r gaussian-distributions-plt, echo = FALSE}
x <- seq(8, -8, length = 500)
df <- data.frame(density = c(dnorm(x, 0, 1), dnorm(x, 0, 2), dnorm(x, 2, 1), dnorm(x, -2, 1)),
                 x = rep(x, 4),
                 distribution = factor(rep(c("mean = 0; var = 1", "mean = 0; var = 4",
                                             "mean = 2; var = 1", "mean = -2; var = 1"), each = 500),

???

To do this we'll need models for the variance of a data set

If we think of the Gaussian distribution that distribution has two parameters, the mean and the variance

In linear regression we model the mean of the response at different values of the covariates, and assume the variance is constant at a value estimated from the residuals

In the left panel I'm showing how the Gaussian distribution changes as we alter the mean while keeping the variance fixed, while in the right panel I keep the mean fixed but vary the variance &mdash; the parameters are independent

# Distributional models

.medium[
$$y_{i} | \boldsymbol{x}_i \sim \mathcal{D}(\vartheta_{1}(\boldsymbol{x}_i), \ldots, \vartheta_{K}(\boldsymbol{x}_i))$$
]

For the Gaussian distribution

* $\vartheta_{1}(\boldsymbol{x}_i) = \mu(\boldsymbol{x}_i)$

* $\vartheta_{1}(\boldsymbol{x}_i) = \sigma(\boldsymbol{x}_i)$

???

Instead of treating the variance as a nuisance parameter, we could model both the variance **and** the mean as functions of the covariates

This is done using what is called a *distributional model*

In this model we say that the response values y_i, given the values of one or more covariates x_i follow some distribution with parameters theta, which are themselves functions of one or more covariates

For the Gaussian distribution theta 1 would be the mean and theta 2 the variance (or standard deviation)

We do not need to restrict ourselves to the Gaussian distribution however

# Pseudonyms

These models in GAM form were originally termed GAMLSS

GAMs for *L*ocation *S*cale *S*hape ([Rigby & Stasinopoulos, 2005](http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9876.2005.00510.x)) in the {gamlss} üì¶

But the name *Distributional* model is more general

---

# Distributional models

In {mgcv} üì¶ special `family` functions are provided for some distributions which allow all parameters of the distribution to be modelled


.row[
.col-5[
* `gaulss()` Gaussian
* `ziplss()` ZI Poisson
* `twlss()` Tweedie
* `gevlss()` GEV
]
.col-7[
* `gamals()` Gamma
* `shash()` 4 parameter Sinh-arcsinh
* `gumbls()` Gumble
]
]

---

# Distributional models

Provide a list of formulas, 1 per linear predictor

```{r eval = FALSE}
gam(list(accel ~ s(times, k = 20, bs = "ad"),
               ~ s(times, k = 10)),
         data = mcycle,
         method = "REML", # <== IIRC REML is only option for these LSS
         family = gaulss())
```

And you need to really understand how these models are parameterised internally and what they are actually fitting and returning

# Quantile GAMs

Briefly, estimating the entire conditional distribution of $\mathbf{y}$ may not be necessary

--

Or even wasteful

--

Instead, if our focus is on a particular part (**quantile**) of the distribution may be better to try to estimate that instead of the whole distribution

--

Quantile regression methods do this

---

# Quantile GAMs

Smoothers for quantile regression models have been available for a long time in the {quantreg} üì¶

These models are estimated using the *pinball loss*

This is suboptimal for model fitting especially with smoothness selection and the ideas implemented in {mgcv} üì¶

Instead, [Fasiolo *et al* (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2020.1725521) ([arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03307)) developed a well-calibrated way of estimating QGAMs with smoothness selection, good inference properties, etc, using a Bayesian belief updating technique

Implemented in the {qgam} üì¶ that builds upon {mgcv} so stuff just works

---

# Quantile GAMs

```{r qgam-example, results = "hide"}
## Load the mcycle data
data(mcycle, package = "MASS")

## Fit QGAM using an adaptive smoother
m_q <- qgam(accel ~ s(times, k = 20, bs = "ad"),
            data = mcycle, # <== no family either
            qu = 0.8) #<<
```

```{r qgam-example-plt, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
## predict to visualise the estimated quantile
## new data to predict at
new_df <- with(mcycle,
               tibble(times = seq(round(min(times)), round(max(times)),
                                  length.out = 200)))
pred <- predict(m_q, newdata = new_df, se.fit = TRUE) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  setNames(c("est", "se")) %>%
  add_confint() %>%
  bind_cols(new_df)

## plot
pred %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = times)) +
    geom_point(data = mcycle, aes(x = times, y = accel)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_line(aes(y = est))
```

# Bayesian GAMs

Briefly (see [Miller 2021](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01330) & Wood 2017 for the gory details)&hellip;

$$\mathcal{L}_{p}(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\lambda}) = \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\beta})\exp(-\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\mathsf{T}}\boldsymbol{S}_{\boldsymbol{\lambda}}\boldsymbol{\beta})$$

The exponential term is porportional to a mean zero MVN with prior precision matrix $\boldsymbol{S}_{\boldsymbol{\lambda}}$

This implies

$$\boldsymbol{\beta} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{S}_{\boldsymbol{\lambda}}^{-})$$

where $\boldsymbol{S}_{\boldsymbol{\lambda}}^{-}$ is a (pseudo)inverse of $\boldsymbol{S}_{\boldsymbol{\lambda}}$

---

# Baysian GAMs

Large entries in $\boldsymbol{S}$ correspond to more wiggly basis functions

We want to penalize these wiggly functions more strongly as we think smoother functions are more likely than wiggly functions

When we invert $\boldsymbol{S}$, these large values turn into small variances

Our prior is that that basis function's coefficient is close to zero

---

# Bayesian GAMs

REML and ML methods are *empirical Bayes* methods

Treating smooths as random effects implies the (improper) Gaussian priors on $\boldsymbol{\beta}$

We fit by maximising the likelihood given this implied prior

*empirical* because we do not have priors for the $\boldsymbol{\lambda}

---

# Priors

It can be very hard to come up with good priors for smoothing parameters themselves

* the true value may be $\infty$ for a linear effect
* making an informed decision (guess) is hard because the $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ are not directly interpretable in terms of something a user is familiar with

Fully Bayesian approach would use

* a vague gamma prior on the each element of $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$, or
* uniform priors on each element of $\log(\boldsymbol{\lambda})$

---

# Obtaining posteriors

In the fully Bayesian approach we attach priors to the $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$

Then use MCMC to obtain posterior draws for all the parameters and the response data

* `mgcv:::jagam()` writes out a *JAGS* code/model file for a specified GAM, edit it, then do the sampling in `JAGS`
* `brms::brm()` takes a formula using {mgcv} notation (`t2()` & `s()` only) for smooths and fits the model using `Stan`
* `BayesX` is a specialised software for fitting Bayesian GAMs. R interface via `BayesX` üì¶
* `bamlss::bamlss()` fits GAMs with {mgcv} notation & smooths via a range of *engines* (`JAGS`, `BayesX`,  internal code, &hellip;)

---

# Obtaining posteriors

In the empirical Bayes world we set priors (implied or otherwise) on the $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ but not the $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ &mdash; posterior for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is conditional on $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$
